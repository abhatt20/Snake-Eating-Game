# Snake-Eating-Game

Everyone has heard about classical snake eats the fruit game. Well, this game simulates that game in a similar fashion. The snake, the fruit and the entire board may look different but the whole logic of the game still remains the same. In this game, you play as the snake who grows bigger in length every time it consumes the fruit. In this context, the fruit can be anything. Cherry, orange, apples, etc. Do snakes even eat apples ?

# Game Logic

As the player, you can move the snake anywhere inside the board(blue rectangular box) using the left, right, up and down arrow keys. There are only two things that you should mainly be aware of. First of all, you lose if you happen to touch the borders of the board. Secondly, the game is over if the snake ends up eating parts of itself, including its tail. After all, this game is all about the snake and the fruit that it consumes.

Word of Advice: The game gets more difficult as the snake gets bigger and bigger in length. Thus, it will be harder to maneuver it around the board. Your best option would be to think of your next plan of action well in advance. 

Have fun !
